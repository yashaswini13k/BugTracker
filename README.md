# BugTracker
A task management app using Angular, Clarity (CLR), Spring Boot, and OracleDB. Testers and developers can log in; testers can add and resolve issues. Clicking an issue row opens a detailed page for comments, assignee info, and more. The issue table supports sorting and filtering via Clarity.
